TO FIX:
 [LOW] When game is over, actions can still be selected
 [MEDIUM] When the screen width is small (mobile) the menu does not appear anymore. It actually doesn't occur always so might be linked to the name of the company or something else.
 [LOW] The graph is not going higher than the objective.
 [LOW] Team A = a1 & a2. b and c are excluded. They both send admissions to Team A. a1 and a2 accept b but don't respond to c's admission. Next turn, a1 and a2 will be able to vote for c's admission from last turn. But b won't be able to vote.
 [MEDIUM] if low and high leaks from same team, there is no check for minimum value of code. (ex : TEAM A (300 lines) makes 1 low leak and 1 high leak to Team B. Team B is supposed to get only 300 lines (150+150 or 0+300) but gets 450 (150+300))

IMPROVEMENTS:
-to have a maximum number of members per team (to avoid unbalanced game). So if a member applies to a company already full, the members have to exclude before hiring

FEATURES:
  [MEDIUM] To have the possibility to send anonymous messages to other team
  [MEDIUM] When creating a game, to be able to choose which days will be end of turns.
