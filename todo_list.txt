TO FIX:
 [LOW] When game is over, actions can still be selected
 [MEDIUM] When the screen width is small (mobile) the menu does not appear anymore. It actually doesn't occur always so might be linked to the name of the company or something else.
 [LOW] The graph is not going higher than the objective.
 [LOW] Team A = a1 & a2. b and c are excluded. They both send admissions to Team A. a1 and a2 accept b but don't respond to c's admission. Next turn, a1 and a2 will be able to vote for c's admission from last turn. But b won't be able to vote.

FEATURES:
  [MEDIUM] To have the possibility to send anonymous messages to other team
  [MEDIUM] To have the detailed results displayed at the end of the game (who did what and when)
  [MEDIUM] When creating a game, to be able to choose which days will be end of turns.
